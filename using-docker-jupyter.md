# Running Docker and Jupyter notebooks on the DGX A100s

If your user account has been given docker permissions, you will be able to use docker as you can on any machine. Below are some specific instructions for using Jupyter notebooks in a collaborative setting on the DGXs.

## Jupyter Notebooks on the DGX A100

**Pre-requisite:** This guide assumes you have permission to use docker with your DGX account. If you are unable to access docker, please reach out to the DSI Data Science Team for support. 

There are 2 steps involved in creating a fully functional jupyter session. First, you must create a docker volume to save your work to. You then need to use the appropriate port forwarding in order to connect to the jupyter session successfully.

**USER 1** 
 
* Log in: `ssh -L xxxx:localhost:xxxx username@XX.XX.XX.XX`

* Create a folder where you would like to store your work within your home directory: `mkdir testfolder`. This "testfolder" is globally unique if being used to create a docker volume. Use `docker volume ls` to see what volume names have already been created. 

**NOTE**: Docker volume names are system-wide unique. Use `docker volume ls` to check if the name you want to use is already taken

* Create the docker volume: `docker volume create --driver local --opt type=none --opt device=/home/username/testfolder --opt o=bind testfolder`

* Now use `docker volume ls` to check if the volume was successfully created. **Deleting a docker volume is not easy - ensure you are ok with the name of the volume you created**

* If you plan on using a repository, clone it within the new folder you created now. 

* Launch Docker: `docker run --gpus all --net=host -it -v testfolder:/workspace/testfolder nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.05-py3` (or any other container image that supports Jupyter notebooks)
 
* Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook: `jupyter-lab --port xxxx`
 
* Now navigate to the URL provided. Change "hostname" to "localhost" and port "8888" to port "xxxx" in the URL. 

* Create any new files in the folder called 'testfolder' within your jupyter session. Any files created in subdirectories above this will not save anywhere. 
 
**For other users wanting to use the same jupyter session (USER 2):**
 
* Log in: `ssh -L yyyy:localhost:8888 username@XX.XX.XX.XX` (note the use of the different localhost â€“ this will allow you to work on your own localhost and not run into the issue of someone else using the same one)
 
* Connect to the running docker container: use `docker ps` to see what containers are running. Identify the one you need (you will need to communicate with your team to determine the correct container. 
 
* Use the command `docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash` to get a bash shell in the container.
 
* Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook: `jupyter-lab --port yyyy`
 
**Provide the SAME TOKEN AS USER 1**
 
You should now be able to use the same jupyter session and docker container.
